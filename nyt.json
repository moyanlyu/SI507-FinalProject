      "summary_short": "After the galloping intelligence displayed in the first two parts of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; series, your fear may be that Peter Jackson would become cautious and unimaginative with the last episode of his trilogy. But Mr. Jackson crushes any such fear. His &quot;King&quot; is a meticulous and prodigious vision made by a director who was not hamstrung by heavy use of computer special-effects imagery. The final installment  follows the hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood), increasingly fevered as the ring exercises its power over him, on the last leg of his perilous journey to Mordor to destroy the sinister object.  The wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), in a voice sodden with mellow sadness, believes that Frodo is on a suicide mission: &quot;There never was much hope. Just a false hope.&quot; Mr. Jackson takes his time with the story, but he's not sloughing off here. Rather he is building toward a more than solid conclusion. The grandiloquence that sustained the second installment, &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; with its pounding and operatic martial fury — a movie that actually created a state of siege and left audiences hanging —  can be found here. By its end, &quot;King&quot; glides to the gentle bonhomie that opened the &quot;Ring&quot; movies, but its epilogue is tinged with regret: &quot;You can't go back. Some wounds don't heal.&quot; It's an epic about the price of triumph, a subversive victory itself in a large-scale pop-action film. — Elvis Mitchell",

There are two groups probably sharing the same dread about this film adaptation of J. R. R.

Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy manifests itself in a gripping, intense fashion in this second of the film adaptations. It may be the first sequel that does not bother to give a reprise of the major plot elements of its predecessor immediately; the plan is simply to drop us right into the action. This stratagem creates a few moments of apprehension, the same disconcerted quality that the hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are experiencing on their journey. Their mission began in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; when Frodo was entrusted with the ring that gives its bearer enormous powers and, incidentally, could begin the end of life on Middle Earth. The warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) has been inflated into an even more assured, reflexive action hero. He helps a bewitched king (Bernard Hill) defend his castle. The action sequences are even more compelling than the first time around; we could be watching Orson Welles's &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot; as directed by George A. Romero — Shakespearean-scale bloodshed and loss as an exploitation movie. There are flaws, particularly the family-oriented video-game aspects, which offer no emotional complications other than saving the day. — Elvis Mitchell",

Keanu Reeves, perhaps worried that he was showing too much range, has purged himself of all expression apart from a worried frown and a sorrowful grimace, which is mirrored in the face of Carrie-Anne Moss, who returns as Trinity. The salient distinction of the human remnants in Zion, apart from their earth-toned natural-fiber fashions, has been the capacity for love, a word much spoken in this movie. But their ranks, in spite of the presence of fine actors like Laurence Fishburne, Harry Lennix and Harold Perrineau, become more robotic with every passing scene. The sole exception is Jada Pinkett Smith as the daredevil pilot Niobe, who brings a touch of bad-girl B-movie attitude into the humorless subterranean gloom. It is not altogether worthless: the Wachowski Brothers still know how to stage an action sequence, and there are some scenes that have a quiet, mysterious beauty. If they would only let go of their grandiose theological pretensions, they might once again be interesting filmmakers. — A. O. Scott",

Though the staging of the action sequences is as viciously elegant as you've been primed to expect, there's a dispiriting more-of-the-same aspect to the picture. The mentor Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and the virtual villain Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) also return, and a whole new group of characters surface as Neo, his lover, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), and the crew continue to fight the oppressive forces threatening to eliminate humanity and the hidden city of Zion. As the middle film of a trilogy, &quot;Reloaded&quot; seeks to increase the emotional stakes — which it doesn't quite accomplish — while leaving enough of a cliffhanger that audiences will be bedeviled enough to flock back into the tents for the last portion. The directors pay their audiences the unlikely compliment of taking them seriously. Unfortunately, they take themselves too seriously. However, &quot;Reloaded&quot; has one of the most excitingly subversive and radical points of view ever seen in a major motion picture — a postmodern purview that accords philosophical ideals from people of color equal weight. This includes the warmhearted spotlight given to Gloria Foster, who returns as Oracle, the source of all knowledge for Neo. — Elvis Mitchell",

But otherwise, the mixture of grandeur and whimsy that made the first three movies so thrilling has been sacrificed to self-importance, an incomprehensible plot and some of the worst screen acting of the year. Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman are dreadful as  Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala, who are reunited (and fall in love) in the midst of a messy political crisis that threatens the stability of the republic and the power of the Jedi order. Millions of people will see this dreary, joyless picture, but only those pursuing advanced degrees in &quot;Star Wars&quot;-ology will be able to appreciate it. — A. O. Scott",

Adrien Brody, in a fluid, understated and thoroughly unsentimental performance, plays Wladislaw Szpilman, a popular concert pianist who survived, against odds that can only be described as absurd, the German occupation of Warsaw and the inferno of the city's Jewish ghetto. With relentless clarity, Mr. Polanski tracks the deterioration of his hero's situation and the day-in, day-out assault on his humanity. There are scenes of unwatchable brutality as well as of kindness and solidarity, but what is most remarkable is the sense of daily life in impossible conditions. The last part of the movie, in which Szpilman is first trapped in a safe house and then condemned to wander the bombed-out city, is a tour de force, at once harrowing and strangely comic. — A. O. Scott",

Worth seeing just for its Forest Spirit, which takes animal form by day and roams the night as a diaphanous, Godzilla-like divinity. The image of plants and flowers springing to life beneath his hooves is ravishingly presented. Despite a superb blend of hand-drawn cels and fluid, computer-generated animation, the film's look is gratifyingly understated. — Janet Maslin",

Harry Thomason, is, of course, the celebrated friend of Bill Clinton who, as the producer of such Southern-fried situation comedies as &quot;Designing Women&quot; and &quot;Evening Shade,&quot; was Mr. Clinton's Hollywood connection. As such, he is hardly a dispassionate observer of what his film terms &quot;the 10-year campaign to destroy Bill Clinton&quot; on the part of conservative activists, though the film does dutifully scold Mr. Clinton for his infidelities. But mostly the film exists to document the vast, unethical lengths Mr. Clinton's enemies went to in hopes of discrediting him, with testimony from cable news regulars like Jeffrey Toobin, James Carville and Paul Begala, as well as figures, like Susan McDougal, involved in the Whitewater investigations. — Dave Kehr",

        "summary_short": "It's probably best that the plot of  &quot;The Hunted&quot; &#151; such as it is &#151; doesn't get in the way of the action sequences, most of which involve Tommy Lee Jones chasing Benecio Del Toro throughout the Pacific Northwest with occasional stops for hand-to-hand combat that make you fear for the actors' safety. Mr. Del Toro is Aaron Hallam, a government-sanctioned killing machine being pursued by L.T. Bonham (Mr. Jones), an independent-contractor tracker brought in by the F.B.I. before Hallam slaughters a cross-section of the population of the Pacific Standard Time Zone. This isn't a movie &#151; it's a police report &#151; and the strictly-the-facts terseness of the story makes that more than clear. That tone is first reflected in the use of Johnny Cash's laconic moroseness over the opening title to set the mood, but it also establishes a level of expectation that the film can't live up to. The director William Friedkin might as well paint bull's-eyes on the backs of the actors, since it's obvious that &quot;The Hunted&quot; regards them as nothing but expendable. &#151; Elvis Mitchell\r\n",

The documentary travels through Mr. Evans's days as a young actor to his sojourn as the head of Paramount Pictures,  when the studio released a storied cluster of hits like &quot;Rosemary's Baby&quot; and &quot;The Godfather.&quot; &quot;There are three sides to every story: my side, your side and the truth,&quot;  Mr. Evans intones, acknowledging his subjective take. But despite — or perhaps because of — his skewed viewpoint, this film succeeds. — Elvis Mitchell",

On its own terms, though, the movie succeeds in dramatizing Mr. Nash's mental illness and, to a lesser extent, his mathematical insights. Russell Crowe's performance is honest and focused, but the movie's conceptions of intellectual life and human character are ultimately so simplistic, so deeply mistrustful of the audience's intelligence that any chance for genuine insight is squandered. – A.

It's speedy, light on its feet and louder than bombs; it's also a lot more fun than the previous &quot;Park&quot; excursions. Much of the talent behind the cameras has done survival-of-the-fittest films before (Joe Johnston's filmography includes &quot;Jumanji&quot;). And they seem determined to check off all the to-do notes necessary for a prehistoric exploitation picture: we're missing only Raquel Welch in a yummy fur bikini. — Elvis Mitchell\r\n",

The movie's stunningly rich visualization of an undersea wonderland is matched by a sense of humor that is fresh, sure of itself, and devoid of the cutesy, saccharine condescension that drips through so many family comedies. The wittiest characters are Marlin's absent-minded traveling companion, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a cheery blue tang afflicted with short-term memory loss, and Bruce  (Barry Humphries), a scary Great White Shark who has adopted a 12-step program to curb  his insatiable appetite for other fish. The movie is not quite up to the level of the &quot;Toy  Story&quot; movies but almost. — Stephen Holden",

The movie, which has the structure of an elaborate mathematical puzzle, is handsome but chilly. For all its metaphysical speculations about the connectedness of things, it feels more like a game than a serious philosophical inquiry. Absorbing nonetheless. - Stephen Holden",

Part comedy, part caper film, this picaresque tale gently satirizes the sillier side of the swinging 60's. It is also a cat-and-mouse game in which Frank tries to elude Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), an earnest, fuddy-fuddy F.B.I. agent who finally catches up with him in France. Mr. DiCaprio, that chameleonic 28-year-old man child, is, in a word, sensational. — A. O. Scott\r\n",

That subject is the story of the German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who stood early in his opposition to Hitler and whose need to be a part of restorative change during World War II later involved him in a conspiracy to assassinate the Nazi leader. Bonhoeffer's part in this plot as a member of the most famous attempt on Hitler's life &#151; a bomb placed in a conference room that came close to achieving its aim &#151; cost him his life just  as the Nazi effort was winding down and Hitler was presumed dead. Bonhoeffer's family, a group of forward-thinkers, is described early in the documentary as &quot;conservative in the best way, open to something new but not losing touch with where they stood.&quot; The filmmaking isn't particularly stirring, but the film itself is comparable to the admirable &#151; and unusual &#151; definition of the word conservative. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",

In Monstropolis, the freakazoid parallel dimension in which the monsters live, children's screams are used as a power source. But any artifact from the human world is a contaminant, so when a 3-year-old girl enters Monstropolis, panic erupts and it's up to two monsters, Sully (John Goodman) and Mike (Billy Crystal), to return her without being blamed for the mishap. There hasn't been a film in years to use creative energy as efficiently as &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;; this is one clean-burning engine that doesn't waste a joke or a thought. – Elvis Mitchell",

With shaggy, baggy looks that belie his performance's fine comic control, Jeff Bridges plays a guy who truly deserves to be called Dude, and is by turns oblivious and indignant once a ruined rug leads him into neo-noir escapades. In a film that certainly keeps its audience guessing what might happen next (Saddam Hussein renting bowling shoes?), John Turturro takes the cake as the most fiendish of bowlers. — Janet Maslin",

This time, it is even briefer: the film unfolds, without skipping a minute, in the hour or so before Jess must catch a plane home to New York, and all those minutes are filled with looping, self-conscious talk as the reunited lovers wander along the Seine.   Their intimacy is tinged with nostalgic regret. The airy sense of freedom   that they shared in their early 20's has given way to the resignation of adulthood, even as they meander toward a second chance. The liberating   sweetness of the earlier movie has mellowed into a saltier, sadder flavor, but Richard Linklater, one of our most literate and intelligent directors, has not talked himself out of the possibility of romance, and the movie's relaxed, discursive structure is dense with implied feeling and oblique drama. — A.

      "summary_short": "This film floats one of the least posed and, therefore, most important  cinematic questions of our time: Can a movie maintain the dramatic integrity of a theme-park ride? In the case of Gore Verbinski's film, the answer is sure. Mr. Verbinski's penchant for logistics combined with the producer Jerry Bruckheimer's desire to spend like a drunken pirate when it comes to putting everything onscreen melt into an often frenetic, colorful and entertaining comic adventure. The dazzling, high-flying silliness is quite an achievement:  the movie is better than it deserves to be, given its origins. In fact, there's enough storyline for several movies. The wiry and beauteous tomboy Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) owns a medallion that gets the plot going roughly a scant hour into &quot;Pirates.&quot; The pirate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) kidnaps Elizabeth because of the medallion, which turns out to be an enchanted piece of gold that can free Barbossa and his swabbies from their curse. They're the larcenous undead whose skeletons can be seen in the moonlight. But the movie belongs to Johnny Depp as the pirate Capt. Jack Sparrow. Gargling his consonants before spitting them out, Mr. Depp suggests a man who has spent either a great deal of time with Keith Richards after a tour of the Rebel Yell factory, or a man who has spent a great deal of time watching Mike Myers do his Keith Richards impression. — Elvis Mitchell",

All this re-examination of the atmosphere of the post-Sputnik era is wrapped up in the story of a bright (and therefore unpopular) little boy who befriends a 50-foot-tall iron robot from who knows where that plunges into the sea one stormy night in 1957 and comes ashore near Rockwell, Me. The boy, Hogarth Hughes, saves the giant when it becomes entangled in high-tension wires, and the big lug becomes his secret playmate. Meanwhile, a nasty, paranoid Government agent is closing in on the giant, leading to a showdown with the military. &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; is a smooth, skilled example of animated filmmaking. Many parents will doubtless approve of the film's messages while they ponder how the passing years have smoothed the jagged edges of history. — Lawrence Van Gelder",
